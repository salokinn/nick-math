//This class will create a basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.


/*
 * So, here's your problem. The plus sign '+', connects the strings being output to the console,
 * it doesn't add them or subtract them.  What you could do is assign variables, but DEFINE them
 * using the current ones you have, not just numbers... like you did on likes 23-25 and 31-33
 * 
 * Redo the multiplication and division to get back into the swing of things.  Then move on to
 * addition and subtraction. If you forget syntax come and ask me.
