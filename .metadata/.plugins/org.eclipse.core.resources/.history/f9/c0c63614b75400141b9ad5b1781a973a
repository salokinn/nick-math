//This class will create a basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.


/* The point of indentation is to organize code.
 * Code does not look good when it is columns of words, it looks great when it is blocked to fit the
 * PARENTHESIS.  The brackets are the definition of blocks of code, so space out your code based on
 * the brackets.  Observe my commenting above to see how you should, from now on, comment things.
 * 
 * Then observe the work I did inside the main function.  See if you can replicate it somehow, and
 * comment how you did it.
