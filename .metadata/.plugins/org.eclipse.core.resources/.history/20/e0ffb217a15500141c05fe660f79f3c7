//This class will create a basic calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers.


/* 
 * Write three identical output lines for addition and for subtraction, but this time
 * use the integers a,b,c for addition and d,e,f for subtraction.  There IS a hint below.
 * 
 * Sidenote: correct errors on lines 35-37
